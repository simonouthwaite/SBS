<p>Databases in Access are composed of four objects: <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>queries</strong>, <strong>forms</strong>, and <strong>reports</strong>. Together, these objects allow you to enter, store, analyze, and compile your data however you want.</p>
<p>In this lesson, you will learn about each of the four<strong> objects</strong> and come to understand how they interact with each other to create a fully functional relational database.</p>
<h3 class="clearfl">Tables</h3>
<p>By this point, you should already understand that a database is a collection of data organized into many connected <strong>lists</strong>. In Access, all data is stored in <strong>tables</strong>, which puts tables at the heart of any database.</p>
<p>You might already know that tables are organized into vertical <strong>columns</strong> and horizontal <strong>rows</strong>.</p>
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_table.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="342" width="700" /></div>
<p>In Access, rows and columns are referred to as <strong>records</strong> and <strong>fields</strong>. A <strong>field</strong> is more than just a column; it’s a way of organizing information by the <strong>type</strong> of data it is. Every piece of information within a field is of the same <strong>type</strong>. For example, every entry in a field called <strong>First Name</strong> would be a name, and every entry in field called <strong>Street Address</strong>would be an address.</p>
<div class="leftImage" rel="width: 535px; margin-top: 0;"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_field_name.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="284" width="535" /></div>
<p>Likewise, a <strong>record</strong> is more than just a row; it's a unit of information. Every cell in a given row is part of that row’s record.<strong></strong></p>
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_record.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="265" width="700" /></div>
<p>Notice how each record spans several fields. Even though the information in each record is organized into fields, it belongs with the other information in that record. See the <strong>number</strong> at the left of each row? It’s the<strong> ID number</strong> that identifies each record. The ID number for a record refers to every piece of information contained on that row.</p>
<div class="leftImage" rel="width: 349px; margin-top: 0;"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_record_ID1.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="284" width="349" /></div>
<p>Tables are good for storing <strong>closely related information</strong>. Let's say you own a bakery and have a database that includes a table with your customers' names and information, like their phone numbers, home addresses, and email addresses. Because these pieces of information are all details on your customers, you’d include them all in the same <strong>table</strong>. Each customer would be represented by a unique <strong>record</strong>, and each type of information about these customers would be stored in its own field. If you decided to add any more information—say, a customer's birthday—you would simply create a new field within the same table.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="full-page-divider introduction-to-objects pagenum-2"></div>
<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-1">Forms, queries, and reports</h3>
<p>Although tables store all of your data, the other three objects—<strong>forms</strong>, <strong>queries</strong>, and <strong>reports</strong>—offer you ways to work with it. Each of these objects interacts with the <strong>records</strong> stored in your database's tables.</p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-2">Forms</h4>
<p><strong>Forms</strong> are used for <strong>entering</strong>, <strong>modifying</strong>, and <strong>viewing</strong> records. You likely have had to fill out forms on many occasions, like when visiting a doctor's office, applying for a job, or registering for school. The reason forms are used so often is that they're an easy way to guide people toward entering data correctly. When you enter information into a form in Access, the data goes exactly where the database designer wants it to go: in one or more related tables.</p>
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_form.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="473" width="700" /></div>
<p>Forms make entering data easier. Working with extensive tables can be confusing, and when you have connected tables you might need to work with more than one at a time to enter a set of data. However, with forms it's possible to enter data into multiple tables at once, all in one place. Database designers can even set restrictions on individual form components to ensure all of the needed data is entered in the correct format. All in all, forms help keep data consistent and organized, which is essential for an accurate and powerful database.</p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-3">Queries</h4>
<p>Queries are a way of <strong>searching </strong>for and <strong>compiling </strong>data from one or more tables. Running a query is like asking a detailed <strong>question</strong> of your database. When you build a query in Access, you are <strong>defining specific search conditions</strong> to find exactly the data you want.</p>
<p>Queries are far more powerful than the simple searches you might carry out within a table. While a <strong>search</strong> would be able to help you find the name of one customer at your business, you could run a <strong>query</strong> to find the name and phone number of every customer who's made a purchase within the past week. A well-designed query can give information you might not be able to find just by looking through the data in your tables.</p>
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_query.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="409" width="531" /></div>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-4">Reports</h4>
<p><strong>Reports </strong>offer you the ability to <strong>present</strong> your data <strong>in print</strong>. If you've ever received a computer printout of a class schedule or a printed invoice of a purchase, you've seen a database report. Reports are useful because they allow you to present components of your database in an easy-to-read format. You can even customize a report's appearance to make it visually appealing. Access offers you the ability to create a report from any <strong>table</strong> or <strong>query</strong>.</p>
<div class="leftImage" rel="width: 642px; margin-top: 0;"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/object_report.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="351" width="642" /></div>
<p></p>
<div class="full-page-divider introduction-to-objects pagenum-3"></div>
<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-5">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Even if you have a good idea of how each object can be used, it can initially be difficult to understand how they all work together. It helps to remember that they all work with the same data. Every piece of data a <strong>query</strong>,<strong> form</strong>, or <strong>report</strong> uses is stored in one of your database<strong> tables</strong>.</p>
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/177/ConL2_1.png" alt="Illustration summarizing Access Objects" height="486" width="601" /></div>
<p>Forms allow you to both <strong>add</strong> data to tables and <strong>view</strong> data that already exists. Reports <strong>present</strong> data from tables and also from queries, which then <strong>search for </strong>and <strong>analyze </strong>data within these same tables.</p>
<p>These relationships sound complicated, but in fact they work together so well and naturally that we often don't even notice when we're using connected database objects. Have you ever used an electronic card catalog to search for a book at the library? Chances are, you entered your search in something that looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-1">Getting to know Access 2013</h3>
<p>Access 2013 uses the <strong>Ribbon</strong> to organize commands, just like in Access 2010 and 2007. If you've used these versions before, Access 2013 will feel familiar. But if you are new to Access or have more experience with older versions, you should first take some time to become familiar with the <strong>Access 2013 interface</strong>.</p>
<p class="chevron">Click the buttons in the interactive below to become familiar with the Access 2013 interface.</p>

<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-2">Working with your Access environment</h3>
<p>If you've previously used Access 2010 or 2007, Access 2013 will feel familiar. It continues to use features like the <strong>Ribbon</strong> and the <strong>Quick Access toolbar</strong>—where you will find commands to perform common tasks in Access—as well as <strong>Backstage view</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-3">The Ribbon</h3>
<p>Access 2013 uses a <strong>tabbed Ribbon system </strong>instead of traditional menus. <strong>The Ribbon</strong> contains <strong>multiple tabs</strong>, each with several <strong>groups</strong> <strong>of commands</strong>. You will use these tabs to perform the most <strong>common tasks</strong> in Access.</p>
<p><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/know_ribbon_callouts.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="288" width="767" /></p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-4">To minimize and maximize the Ribbon:</h4>
<p>The Ribbon is designed to respond to your current task; however, you can choose to <strong>minimize</strong> the Ribbon if you find that it takes up too much screen space.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>arrow</strong> in the lower-right corner of the Ribbon to minimize it.
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/know_ribbon_hide.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="251" width="235" /></div>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Ribbon</strong> will be minimized. Click a <strong>tab</strong> to make the Ribbon reappear. It will disappear again when not in use.
<div class="leftImage" rel="width: 574px; margin-top: 0;"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/know_ribbon_min.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="175" width="574" /></div>
</li>
<li>To <strong>maximize</strong> the Ribbon, click a tab, then click the <strong>pin</strong> icon in the lower-right corner. The Ribbon will appear at all times.
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/know_ribbon_pin.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="244" width="233" /></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-5">The Quick Access toolbar</h3>
<p>The <strong>Quick Access toolbar</strong>, located above the Ribbon, lets you access common commands no matter which tab you are on. By default, it shows the <strong>Save</strong>, <strong>Undo</strong>, and <strong>Repeat</strong> commands. If you'd like, you can <strong>customize</strong> it by <strong>adding additional commands</strong>.</p>
<div class="leftImage" rel="width: 214px; margin-top: 0;"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/know_quick_access.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="147" width="214" /></div>
<p class="attention">Note that the <strong>Save </strong>command only saves the current open object. In addition, the <strong>Undo </strong>command will not undo certain actions, like adding a record. Pay close attention to your information when using the <strong>Undo</strong>command to make sure it has the desired effect.</p>
<div class="full-page-divider getting-started-with-access pagenum-3"></div>
<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-6">Backstage view</h3>
<p><strong>Backstage view</strong> gives you various options for saving, opening, and printing your database.</p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-7">To access Backstage view:</h4>
<ol>

<h3 id="sidenav-lesson-2">Working with objects</h3>
<p>It's helpful to think of your database as a large binder or folder in which you store your data. The data itself is contained in database <strong>objects</strong>. Access treats each of these objects as separate documents, which means you will have to <strong>open</strong> and<strong> save</strong> them individually in order to work with them.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that this lesson contains no instructions for saving a database. This is because you cannot save an entire database at once. Rather, you must individually save the objects contained within the database.</p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-3">To open an object:</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Navigation pane</strong>, locate and double-click the desired object.
<div class="leftImage"><img class="imageBorder" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/236/open_object_select.png" alt="Screenshot of Access 2013" height="413" width="352" /></div>

<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-4">Saving objects</h4>
<p>You'll need to <strong>save</strong> any changes you make to each object before closing your database. Remember, saving early and often can prevent your work from being lost. However, you will also be prompted to save any unsaved work when you attempt to close your database.</p>
<h4 id="sidenav-lesson-5">To save a new object:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object you want to save by clicking its tab in the <strong>Document Tabs bar</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the<strong> Save </strong>command on the<strong> Quick Access toolbar</strong>, or press <strong>Ctrl+S</strong> on your keyboard.
