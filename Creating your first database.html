<p>When you choose to create a blank database, that’s exactly what you get—a new, empty database file with no tables or other database objects. Starting from scratch is the best way to learn about Access. It’s also the favorite choice of database experts, who prefer to create everything themselves so it’s exactly the way they like it.</p>
<p>Other templates let you create databases that are preconfigured for specific scenarios and certain types of data. The box on <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch01.html#templates_one_size_fits_some" title="Templates: One Size Fits Some">Templates: One Size Fits Some</a> has more information.</p>
<p>The cool-sounding “Custom web app” template is a special case. It lets you create a web-enabled database that runs on SharePoint. You’ll explore this new feature (and its limitations), in <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. Building an Access Web App">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
<p>No matter which template you click, Access pops open a new window that lets you choose a name and location for your new database (<a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch01.html#this_database_will_be_named_bobbleheadac" title="Figure 1-2. This database will be named Bobblehead.accdb.

<p>The example in this section shows you how to create a blank database. However, if you scroll down (on the right side of the <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch01.html#when_you_start_access_you_see_this_two-p" title="Figure 1-1. When you start Access, you see this two-part welcome page. On the left is a list of recently opened databases (if you have any). On the right is a list of templates that you can use to create a new database.">Figure 1-1</a>), you’ll find a long list of prebuilt databases, which are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>templates</em></span>. Templates aim to save you the work of <a id="idx-CHP-1-0029" class="indexterm"></a>creating a new database and let you jump straight to the fine-tuning and data-entry stage.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there’s a price to be paid for this convenience. Even if you find a template that stores the type of information you want to track, you might find that the predefined structure isn’t quite right. For example, if you choose to use the Home Inventory template to track all the stuff in your basement, you might find that it’s missing some information you want to use (like the projected resale value of your stuff on eBay) and includes other details you don’t care about (like the date you acquired each item). To make this template work, you’ll need to change the design of your table, which involves the same Access know-how as creating one.</p>
<p>In this book, you’ll learn how to build your own databases from the ground up and customize every square inch of them. Once you’re an Access master, you can spend many fun hours playing with the prebuilt templates and adapting them to suit your needs. To give it a whirl, click one of a dozen or so templates that are shown in the main Access window. Or, even better, hunt for more by using the Search box at the top of the Access window, which scans through the thousands of templates available on Microsoft’s Office website.</p>

<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Type a file name for the database you’re about to create</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Access stores all the information for a database in a single file with the extension <span class="emphasis"><em>.accdb</em></span> (which stands for “Access database”). Don’t stick with the name Access picks automatically (like “Database1.accdb”). Instead, pick something more descriptive. In this example, Bobblehead.accdb does the trick.<a id="idx-CHP-1-0030" class="indexterm"></a></p>
<p>As with any other file, <a id="idx-CHP-1-0031" class="indexterm"></a>Access files can contain a combination of letters, spaces, numbers, parentheses, hyphens (-), and the underscore (_). It’s generally safest to stay away from other special characters, some of which aren’t allowed.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Tables</em></span> are information containers. Every database needs at least one table—without it, you can’t store any data. In a simple database, like the Bobblehead database, a single table (which we’ll call Dolls) is enough. But if you find yourself wanting to store several lists of related information, you need more than one table. In the database BigBudgetWedding.accdb, you may want to keep track of the guests that you invited to your wedding, the gifts that you requested, and the loot that you actually received. In <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Linking Tables with Relationships">Chapter 5</a>, you’ll see plenty of examples of databases that use multiple tables.<a id="I_indexterm1_id439931" class="indexterm"></a></p>

In this table, it’s clear that you’ve added five bobblehead dolls. You’re storing information for each doll in five fields (ID, Character, Manufacturer, PurchasePrice, and DateAcquired).</div>
</div>
<p>Before you start designing this table, you need to know some very basic rules:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>A table is a group of</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>records</em></span>. A record is a collection of information about a single thing. In the Dolls table, for example, each record represents a single bobblehead doll. In a Family table, each record would represent a single relative. In a Products table, each record would represent an item that’s for sale. You get the idea. When you create a new database, Access starts you out with a new table named <span class="emphasis"><em>Table1</em></span>, although you can choose a more distinctive name when you decide to save it.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Each record is subdivided into</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>fields</em></span>. Each field stores a distinct piece of information. For example, in the Dolls table, one field stores the person on whom the doll is based, another field stores the price, another field stores the date you bought it, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Tables have a rigid structure</strong></span>. In other words, you can’t bend the rules. If you create four fields, <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> record must have four fields (although it’s acceptable to leave some fields blank if they don’t apply).<a id="I_indexterm1_id440048" class="indexterm"></a></p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Newly created tables get an ID field for free</strong></span>. The ID field stores a unique number for each record. (Think of it as a reference number that will let you find a specific record later on.) The best part about the ID field is that you can ignore it when you’re entering a new record. Access chooses a new ID number for you and inserts it in the record automatically. You’ll learn much more about ID fields on <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch02.html#autonumber" title="AutoNumber">AutoNumber</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2" title="Creating a Simple Table">
<p>When you first create a database, it’s almost empty. But to get you started, Access creates your first database object—a table named Table1. The problem is, this table begins life completely blank, with no defined fields (and no data).<a id="idx-CHP-1-0040" class="indexterm"></a></p>
<p>If you followed the steps in the previous section to create a new database, you’re already at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Datasheet view</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch01.html#in_a_table_each_record_occupies_a_separa" title="Figure 1-5. In a table, each record occupies a separate row.

You’re storing information for each doll in five fields (ID, Character, Manufacturer, PurchasePrice, and DateAcquired).">Figure 1-5</a>), which is where you enter data into a table. All you need to do is customize this table so that it meets your needs.</p>
<p>You can customize a table in two ways:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Design view</strong></span> lets you precisely define all aspects of a table before you start using it. Almost all database pros prefer Design view, and you’ll start using it in <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building Smarter Tables">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Datasheet view</strong></span> is where you enter data into a table. Datasheet view also lets you build a table on the fly as you insert new information. You’ll use this approach in this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following steps show you how to turn a blank new table (like Table1) into the Dolls table by using the Datasheet view:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>To define your table, simply add your first record</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In this case, that means choosing a bobblehead doll to add to the list. For this example, you’ll use a nifty Homer Simpson replica.</p>
<div class="note" title="Note">
<h3 class="title"><a id="note-4"></a>NOTE</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter which doll you enter first. Access <a id="idx-CHP-1-0041" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idx-CHP-1-0042" class="indexterm"></a>tables are <span class="emphasis"><em>unsorted</em></span>, which means they have no underlying order.

</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>In the datasheet’s rightmost column, under the “Click to Add” heading, type the first piece of information for the record (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/access-2013-the/9781449359447/ch01.html#to_fill_in_your_first_record_start_by_en" title="Figure 1-6. To fill in your first record, start by entering something in the first field of information (like the doll name “Homer Simpson”).

<p>Based on the <a id="idx-CHP-1-0044" class="indexterm"></a>simple analysis you performed earlier, you know that you need to enter four fields of information for every doll. For the Homer Simpson doll, this information is “Homer Simpson” (the name), “Fictional Industries” (the manufacturer), “$7.99” (the price), and today’s date (the purchase date).
